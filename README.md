# ML-and-DL-Algorithms-From-Scratch

This repository contains my custom implementations of various **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **statistical** algorithms built from scratch using **Python**. Each algorithm is developed without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, focusing instead on the underlying mathematical concepts and fundamental mechanics.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **AutoEncoder** – Implementation of an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction.
- **Decision Tree Classifier** – Model based on decision rules learned from data features.
- **Deep Neural Network** – A neural network implemented from scratch including forward and backward propagation.
- **K Nearest Neighbors** – A simple, instance-based classifier using distance metrics.
- **K-means** – Unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data.
- **Linear Regression** – Fundamental regression model estimating relationships between variables.
- **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification algorithm using sigmoid activation.
- **Naive Bayesian Classifier** – Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem with strong independence assumptions.
- **Word2Vec** – Implementation of the Word2Vec model and its training dataset.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to deepen understanding of how ML and DL algorithms work internally by building them manually, step by step. This helps strengthen your grasp of the math behind these models and how they are optimized in practice.

## 📌 Notes

- No high-level ML/DL libraries are used.
- Pure Python and NumPy implementations (where applicable).
- Designed for educational purposes and algorithmic transparency.
